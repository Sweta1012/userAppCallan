# Overview

The goal of this development test is to show us that you have a grasp of how to use React, Typescript, node, express and npm (or that you're capable of figuring it out if you don't already know all of these technologies). Please build a React interface that interacts with an API built in express. You'll find the mock user data in `api/src/data/user_database.csv`

# Getting Started

The code files are provided without any of the dependencies installed, so you will need to run npm install in both the `api` folder and the `front-end` folder. Please delete your node_modules folders before sending your code back to us.

# Requirements

Build an interface in react that has the following screens:

- user list page with all users with the ability to filter the list by typing in a name
- individual pages for each user with their first name, last name, email and age
- a dashboard with some aggregate information
  - number of users
  - average user age
  - median user age
  - top 5 most common first names

# Notes

This test is meant to be open ended, so you are free to design the interface and the api endpoints however you see fit to meet the requirements listed above. The look and feel aren't all that important, so we'd advise just focusing on the functionality.  
Please delete your node_modules folder before sending your code back to us.
